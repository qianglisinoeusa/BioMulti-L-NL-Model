# 1. BioMulti-L-NL-Model

The biological possible multi-layer linear+nonlinear visual information processing model

DigitialBrain Version 3.0
Visual Computing

Human visual inspired multi-layer LNL model. In this model, the main 
component are:

Nature Image --> VonKries Adaptation --> ATD  (Color processing phase)
Wavelets Transform --> Contrast sensivity function (CSF) --> Divisive
Normalization(DN)  --> Noise(Gaussian or Poisson)

Evalute of model with TID2008 database.

Redundancy redunction measure with Total Correlation(RBIG or Cortex module)

This model derivated two version scriptï¼š Matlab, Python. In the future, I
want to implemented all of these code on C++ or Java. If our goal is 
simulate of primate brain, we need to implement all everything to High 
performance Computer(HPC) with big framework architecture(C/C++/Java).


The Python version model inspired by matlab version. The matlab version also
get under request.
