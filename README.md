# 1. BioMulti-L-NL-Model

The biological possible multi-layer linear+nonlinear visual information processing model

DigitialBrain Version 3.0(Complex and Test Version)
Visual Computing

Human visual inspired multi-layer LNL model. In this model, the main 
component are:

Nature Image --> VonKries Adaptation --> ATD  (Color processing phase)
Wavelets Transform --> Contrast sensivity function (CSF) --> Divisive
Normalization(DN)  --> Noise(Gaussian or Poisson)

Evalute and optimise model with TID2008 database -  one of image quality databases.

Redundancy redunction measure with Total Correlation(RBIG or Cortex module) - under constructation

This model derivated two version scriptï¼š Matlab, Python. In the future, I
want to implemented all of these code on C++ or Java. If our goal is 
simulate of primate brain, we need to implement all everything to High 
performance Computer(HPC) with big framework architecture(C/C++/Java).
 

The Python version model inspired by matlab version. The matlab version also
get under request.


# 2. How to use it

@ caution: The code only can execute under conda envionment or virtual environment, otherwise,
it will cause errors.

a. First, run InstallDepedendent.sh to download and install dependent toolboxes.
b. Second, run main.sh to execute main funtion.
